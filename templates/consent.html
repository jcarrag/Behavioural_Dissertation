            <p>Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study.
            Below is an informed consent form that briefly describes the nature of
            the study and what to expect. Please take the time to read this over
            before deciding to participate in the study.</p>

            <p>We would like to invite you to participate in this research project
            directed by researchers at UCL. You should only participate if you want
            to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way.
            Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you
            to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others
            if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you
            would like more information.</p>

            <p>Details of the study</p>

            <p>This study involves a decision making task in which you will be asked to
            make a number of choices between four options. Each decision will earn
            you points, and the final payment for your participation will depend on
            the number of points you earned.</p>

            <p>This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee
            CPB/2009/020R. All data will be handled according to the Data Protection
            Act 1998 and will be kept anonymous. Only UCL researchers working with
            Dr. Maarten Speekenbrink will have access to the data collected.</p>

            the information sheet. I understand that I am free to withdraw from the

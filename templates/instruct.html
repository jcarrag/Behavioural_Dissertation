		<p id="inst">In this task you will be presented with four decks of cards. Each card has an associated number of
            points that you win if you select that card. On each trial, you will be asked to select one deck to draw a
            card from. You will then be shown the number of points you won.

            <div id="condText"></div>

            <p>You will be shown this information for 3 seconds. You won't be able to make your next choice from the decks
            during this time.</p>

            <p>Some decks may be better than others but as the amount they tend to give may vary from trial to trial,
            this can change.</p>

            <p>You are free to select from any deck at any time. Your only objective is to win as many points as possible.
            You will be paid a basic fee of 50 cents. The total amount you will receive for completing the task
            increases with the points you earn, at a rate of 10 cents per 1500 points. Your final payment will be
            rounded to the nearest cent.</p>
